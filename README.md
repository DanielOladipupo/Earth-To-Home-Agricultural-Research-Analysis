### Introduction 
This report examines the unit economics and value chain within the agriculture and grocery sectors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, to uncover key trends and opportunities for improvement. By analyzing the distribution of agricultural activities across South Africa, the study highlights disparities in farm distribution, gross margins across supply chain stakeholders, and production trends for both crops and livestock.

As such, it serves as a foundation for informed decision-making, enabling stakeholders to optimize operations, improve profitability, and foster sustainable practices in the agriculture and grocery sectors. Insights derived from this study will also contribute to developing strategies that support farmers and enhance food supply chain efficiency.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
I analyzed the dataset to understand its structure, identify key patterns, and uncover valuable insights. It was important to determine the total distribution of farms across provinces in South Africa and evaluating the gross margin for various distribution channels. Additionally, I discovered two key agricultural contexts in Gauteng province: crop production and animal production.
### Insights
- **Farm Distribution by Province:** Provinces with larger rural areas, such as the Free State, dominate farming activity, while urbanized regions like Gauteng have fewer farms.
- **Gross Margins in the Value Chain:** Farmers capture the largest share of the gross margin, indicating the value of primary production, while wholesalers operate on narrower profit margins.
- **Crop and Livestock Production:** Grain/cereal and maize dominate crop production in Gauteng, while cattle and pigs lead livestock farming. Smaller-scale livestock and specialty crops cater to specialized markets.
